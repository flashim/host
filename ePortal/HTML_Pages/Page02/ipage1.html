				<p>No one client is alike. They are impacted by the industry in which they operate, and their business issues vary greatly. Similarly, technical accounting issues impact their organizations in different ways, and how participants react to training will vary significantly.</p>

				<p>You know your client, <b><i>and only you know what those specific business needs are.</i></b> The first step in delivering quality training is to determine what, if any, revisions are necessary to make sure the course meets your clients' individual needs.</p>

				<p>Begin by carefully <b><i>reviewing the entire set of course materials.</i></b> In some cases the materials may simply be a PowerPoint presentation, but in other instances the materials may include a Leader Guide, Participant Materials and handouts. During your review you should do the following:</p>
                
                <ul>
                	<li>Identify any information that may not be relevant for your client.</li>
                   	<li>Confirm currency/accuracy of content. All KPMG Learning courses contain a "current as of date" which identifies when the course was approved by risk management for use in the KPMG Learning platform.  While the <a href="mailto:us-learning@kpmg.com" class="externalLink">KPMG Learning Management Team</a> strives to keep all material on the website as current as possible, the responsibility for ensuring accuracy of content delivered <b><i>remains with the engagement team.</i></b></li>
                    <li>Look for opportunities to "bring it home" â€“ i.e., to discuss how a particular teaching point might directly impact the client. Time has been added to the agendas for each <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> course to allow for these additional teaching points.</li>
                   	<li>Think about relevant examples that would resonate with your client. Based on client feedback, one of the most valuable aspects of credible training is when an instructor introduces their own real-life experiences into the presentation.  Time has been added to the agendas for each <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> course to allow for these additional teaching points.</li>
                    <li>Identify instances where asking your clients to share their own situations or experiences with a particular teaching point would add additional value.</li>
                </ul>
