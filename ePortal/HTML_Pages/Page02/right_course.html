				KPMG Learning courses on a particular topic are grouped by knowledge level – overview, basic, intermediate, advanced, and update. This information helps make choosing a course that best reflects the audience identified in your analysis easier than starting from scratch. </td>

So if your client is only interested in courses that are CPE-worthy, use the CPE filter function within the Search feature to find courses that meet your client's CPE needs.<br/><br />

				<i>Note: There are several requirements that must be met before CPE credit can be awarded to clients for successful completion of KPMG-delivered training. Review the CPE tab for more information and specific requirements that must be completed prior to, during and after delivering training sessions to clients.</i> </td>

				In some cases, a combination of two modes might be the best solution for your client. For example, participating in a brief webcast or self-study could be followed up by a half-day Instructor-led session that would allow your clients to further explore a particular topic and discuss with you how the issues presented might directly impact their organization. </td>
