				<div class="bluebox">Understand Your Client’s Needs</div>
				
				<p></p>
				
				<p>You'll produce the best training for your client if you begin by analyzing three important areas:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The business goals your client wants to achieve;</li>
					<li>The material that must be taught; and</li>
					<li>The learners' current capabilities.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div id="box1">
                
					<p>Analysis serves a major role in the quality assurance process. It defines the <b><i>project's needs and ways to measure its success.</i></b> 
					If you skip analysis, you can easily introduce mistaken assumptions into your training course. These could include:</p>
					<div class="emptyDiv togglebox" style="padding:1px;">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Wrong focus</strong> -- the course content may not address the client’s business needs.</li>
						<li><strong>Too easy or too hard</strong> -- the course could bore or frustrate the learners.</li>
						<li><strong>Incomplete, redundant, or inaccurate content</strong> -- the course might not teach the correct material.</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
				  <p>Starting your project with a thorough analysis allows you to collect critical information about business needs, 
					learners' capabilities and course content. Here are some of the questions you might ask your client to understand their needs:</p>
	 
					<ul>
						<li>What is the business need driving this training course?</li>
						<li>What are the goals and objectives for this training course?</li>
						<li>How will you define success for both the learner and the course?</li>
						<li>Who is the intended training audience?</li>
						<li>What do the members of the learning audience already know?</li>
						<li>What do they need to learn?</li>
						<li>Is your client mainly interested in meeting CPE requirements?</li>
					</ul>
					
					<div class="greybox">
					<p>The <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> catalog has a multitude of courses that are “classroom-ready.” Some of these may meet your client’s needs "as is," or with some modest tailoring or revision. The catalog also contains links to KPMG’s Institute webcasts and KPMG’s Executive Education public offerings.  Perhaps one of these is the best fit for your client. Or, if your client needs some quick CPE on a specific topic, take a look at the many CPE-worthy online self-study courses.  There’s an excellent chance that one or more of the <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> offerings is exactly what your client is looking for.</p>

					<p>The <a href="mailto:us-learning@kpmg.com" class="externalLink">KPMG Learning Management Team</a> is here to help you through this analysis phase. <b><i>Reach out to us</i></b> if you have any questions or would like us to participate in the analysis with you and your client.</p>
