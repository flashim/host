				<p><p><b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> offers easy access to a multitude of training courses that cover prime areas of interest, including <b><i>changing 
				standards covering revenue recognition, fair value and leases</i></b>. Via the internal portal, KPMG partners and professionals can search 
				for and identify training courses that they share with their clients in the marketplace.  These training modules are available in 
				an array of learning modalities such as traditional classroom, live on-line sessions (via the <a href="http://www.kpmginstitutes.com/" target="_blank" class="externalLink">KPMG Institutes</a>) and web-based self-study.</p>

				<p>But <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> is more than just a valuable training resource. It’s a "door opener" to your 
				clients and targets. <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> gives you a terrific platform from which you can present your 
				strategies and ideas to clients and prospects to address current challenges or future opportunities. 
				Studies have clearly demonstrated that training and education are excellent ways to enhance business relationships. 
				Equally important, <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> can help your clients fill “skill gaps” in specific topics or issues.</p>

				<p>To further enhance your relationship with clients and targets, KPMG has created an <a href="#" class="externalLink">external version</a> of <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b>. 
				It offers the same training, resources and in-depth technical knowledge found in the internal version directly to the 
				marketplace. KPMG has been providing executive training and education to clients for more than 20 years, and our 
				programs are well known and highly regarded throughout the industry.</p>

				<p>With <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b>, clients have direct access to risk-approved and easy-to-use web-based training modules 
				and study materials covering today’s key issues (refer to the <a href="../pageAssets/docs/course_catalog.pdf" target="_blank" class="externalLink">Course Catalog</a> for a complete list). Users can also search 
				for and find upcoming webcasts, Executive Education public offerings, and identify certain programs that can be taught on 
				site at the client/target location.</p>

				<p>Massive changes are underway across the accounting industry, and most of these changes have significantly accounting 
				and reporting implications. Standards and best practices are also evolving rapidly. Now more than ever, our clients and 
				targets need valuable <i><u>and</u></i> timely help <i>&quot;cutting through complexity&quot;</i>—to effectively manage their business and remain 
				profitable.</p>

				<p><b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> is the latest example of how KPMG is delivering on its corporate mission. The <a href="#" target="_blank" class="externalLink">internal portal</a>
				and the <a href="#" target="_blank" class="externalLink">external Web site</a> provide valuable thought leadership and demonstrate your credibility in understanding accounting issues, which will 
				enhance your business relationships.</p>
