				<p></p>
				<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
				<p></p>
				
				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q1');">Have the courses on KPMG Learning been pre-approved?</a></div>
				<div id="q1" class="answer hidden"><p>Yes. All courses in the <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> catalog have been reviewed for currency and technical accuracy, and are approved for use with both clients and targets.  No additional content approvals are required if the courses are delivered <i>as-designed</i>.
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q2');">If I need to change or alter a course content, what approvals are needed before I deliver the course to a client?</a></div>
				<div id="q2" class="answer hidden"><p>We are aware that, in some cases, <i>as-designed</i> training content may not meet the specific needs of your client or target, and tailoring or revision is required. Knowing how to obtain the <b>appropriate internal approvals</b> prior to providing training externally is vital to our organization.</p> 
				<p>According to firm policy, any significant revisions should be reviewed by the engagement partner and if the partner deems necessary, by an additional field subject matter professional with considerable knowledge and experience in the specific content area.</p>  

				<p>In addition, revising a course to the extent that the <u>field of study</u> is impacted or the <u>length of the program</u> increases or decreases more than 15% may have Continuing Professional Education (CPE) implications (refer to the <a href="../pageAssets/docs/cpe_tookit.pdf" target="_blank" class="externalLink">CPE Toolkit</a> section for more information).
				</p> 
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q3');">Who will need to review my training content during the QA process?</a></div>
				<div id="q3" class="answer hidden"><p>Significant revisions should be reviewed by the engagement partner and if the partner deems necessary, by an additional field subject matter professional with considerable knowledge and experience in the specific content area.  </p>
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q4');">Do I still need to go through a discrete B&RC review process?  How can I ensure that my content is consistent with B&RC policy?</a></div>
				<div id="q4" class="answer hidden">The B&RC review step has been eliminated for most content, as key support groups, such as NDPPS Editorial, have been trained on B&RC policies.</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q5');">When should I go through NDPPS Editorial?</a></div>
				<div id="q5" class="answer hidden">NDPPS Editorial review should be consulted BEFORE submission to the engagement partner for review.</div>
				
				<!--
				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q6');">How long does the review process take? What should I do if my request is urgent?</a></div>
				<div id="q6" class="answer hidden"><p>Reviews can take up to 3–10 business days after partner sponsor review depending upon subject matter, volume, 
				intended distribution, and complexity so it is critical to ensure that the appropriate time is built into your project plan.</p>

					<p>If you have an urgent request, please complete the following steps:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Contact the QA team (US-CSS Content QA Mailbox) as soon as you know that you will have an urgent request so that the appropriate FQA and national reviewers can be notified in advance.</li>
							<li>When completing the intake form, select the “Urgent Review” box in the intake form and provide the requested date and the name of the approving partner.</li>
							<li>Contact the QA core team as soon as the QA intake form has been completed and submitted. Depending on the complexity of the content, they will do whatever they can to move it quickly and efficiently through the process.</li>
							<li>If the content will be split up into different submissions, all submissions should start with an identical subject line (“Content Title”) to assist with tracking and reporting (example:  Project XY: Submission 1, Project XY: Submission 2).</li>
							<li>Consider obtaining NDPPS Editorial review before submission to the QA process to ensure content is of the appropriate quality and avoid further delay.</li>
						</ul>
					
					</div>


				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q7');">Who will need to review my content during the QA process?</a></div>
				<div id="q7" class="answer hidden"><p>Your responses to the intake form determine who will need to review the content. After completion of the intake form, 
				content is automatically classified as Level 1, 2, or 3 based upon subject matter, intended distribution, and complexity 
				of the content submitted. Based on the responses of the content creator, the workflow will guide materials accordingly 
				through the process.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><b>Level 1</b> content requires partner sponsor approval only (includes content for limited distribution with no description or standard descriptions of firm’s services).</li>
						<li><b>Level 2</b> content requires partner sponsor and FQA review (includes content for wide distribution with no description or standard descriptions of firm’s services).</li>
						<li><b>Level 3</b> content requires partner sponsor, field quality assurance FQA and national review (includes content for wide distribution including discussion of new services, technical,  legal, political, or controversial topics).</li>
					</ul>
				
				<p>One of the objectives of developing the new QA process is to reduce the volume of materials being escalated to the 
				national review groups. By requiring that all content be submitted using the intake form, we can help ensure that 
				unnecessary escalations are kept to a minimum. The nature of the content you submit will determine which national 
				review groups must review and approve the material prior to distribution. This approach will help eliminate duplicate or 
				unnecessary reviews.</p>

				<p>Materials that reference controversial, complex, or sensitive issues require escalation to the appropriate national review 
				groups in order to provide appropriate risk management (known as Level 3 content). The following national review groups 
				participate in the QA review process:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Risk Management – Advisory, Audit, Tax, Information Technology</li>
						<li>Office of the General Counsel</li>
						<li>Office of Government Affairs</li>
						<li>Washington National Tax</li>
						<li>Department of Professional Practice</li>
					</ul>	
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q8');">What is the responsibility of the partner sponsor?</a></div>
				<div id="q8" class="answer hidden"><p>The QA process closely aligns the review responsibility with the business team that will be using the content. All new 
				knowledge content must have a partner as its sponsor, who will take responsibility for the nature of the content and the 
				quality of its presentation.</p>

				<p>After content is submitted through the intake form, partners will receive an e-mail from us-portalsupportmb@kpmg.com 
				with a subject line of “Knowledge Content: Review Request - RISK - ACTION REQUIRED” that provides the sponsor with 
				basic information about the request and a link to an online tool to approve or reject the request. The review process will 
				not continue until this step is completed. Please note that this task cannot be delegated to administrative assistants or 
				other personnel. The approval must be provided by a partner from his or her laptop. The Partner Sponsor Form has 
				recently been modified and the review and approval have been condensed in a single page to simplify the approval 
				process.</p>

				<p>If the partner sponsor selected on the intake form is not available to provide the approval, select another partner to 
				perform this task and notify the QA core team at US-CSS ContentQA Mailbox to make the change in the workflow tool 
				and send the approval request to the new sponsor.</p></div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q9');">What does FQA stand for and who are they?</a></div>
				<div id="q9" class="answer hidden">Field Quality Assurance (FQA) reviewers are nominated and receive training in overseeing materials through the new 
				process. The FQA reviewers serve as concurring reviewers and approvers and are responsible for conducting quality 
				reviews of Level 2 and 3 content. They also escalate content for Level 3 (national) reviews when necessary.</div>
				
				
				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q10');">Do I still need to go through a discrete B&RC review process for content submitted through the QA process? <br>How can I ensure that my content is consistent with B&RC policy?</a></div>
				<div id="q10" class="answer hidden"><p>All content submissions covered by the QA process will be required to adhere to the new process which has eliminated 
				routine review by the U.S. B&RC team. The B&RC review step has been eliminated for most content, as key support 
				groups, such as NDPPS Editorial, have been trained on B&RC policies.</p>

				<p>The key resource available to content creators and partner sponsors is the B&RC Advisor Network. This consists of firm 
				personnel with knowledge and understanding of the B&RC policies and how they are to be applied to the firm’s 
				knowledge content. The current Network membership list is available on the QA Portal page.</p>

				<p>NDPPS Editorial also has the knowledge and understanding to assist in this capacity.  Consulting with a B&RC 
				advisor or submitting your content to NDPPS in the early stages of content development is strongly recommended.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q11');">When should I go through NDPPS Editorial?</a></div>
				<div id="q11" class="answer hidden">NDPPS Editorial review should be consulted BEFORE submission to the QA process to help ensure that content is 
				of the appropriate quality prior to submission to avoid delays. To avoid duplicative efforts and incremental costs when 
				using NDPPS Editorial to make any necessary edits after the QA process, please ensure that the same editor/ 
				designer is used and any changes from the original version are noted.</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q12');">What type of global content should be submitted through the QA review process?</a></div>
				<div id="q12" class="answer hidden"><p>Global content only needs to be submitted through the QA process if the content meets the criteria described below.</p>

				<p>If content has not yet been published, global content should only be submitted for review through the new QA process if one or more of the following criteria are met:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A change over to a U.S. copyright (KPMG LLP) from an ex-U.S. firm or KPMG International copyright</li>
						<li>U.S. author or partner sponsor (this applies  to U.S. Partners acting in a global role)</li>
					</ul>
					
				<p>If content has already been published globally and a request has been made to distribute the content within the United 
				States, global content should be submitted for review through the new QA process if one or more of the criteria above 
				are met and/or if content will be widely distributed/posted in the United States.</p>

				<p>Global content is also subject to Global Marketing Risk Management (GMRM, f/k/a GB&RC) review. Please note 
				that internal materials will no longer require GMRM review unless they are ultimately  meant to be market-facing 
				(e.g., pitch books, proposal content posted on portals or with proposal systems) or provide descriptions for marketing 
				or cross-selling services or products (e.g., L&D sales courses, product launch materials).</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q13');">How do I access review notes from the FQA and national reviewers?</a></div>
				<div id="q13" class="answer hidden"><p>Once the content has been approved by the sponsor, it will continue on to other reviewers, as applicable, automatically. 
				If other reviewers have comments, they will contact you and/or document their comments in the online tool for you to 
				review (you will be prompted by e-mail).</p>

				<p>Click on the name of the content in the e-mail you received from us- portalsupportmb@kpmg.com. This will take you 
				to the online QA intake form that contains the content being reviewed. Follow instructions on the form very closely. 
				At the bottom of each page is either a ’Submit’ or ’Go’ option. This must be selected in order for the form to close 
				correctly. Do not just close the browser.</p>

				<p>Any questions regarding review notes should be sent directly to the assigned FQA reviewer or the national review 
				groups.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q14');">Is there training available for content creators and sponsoring partners?</a></div>
				<div id="q14" class="answer hidden">There is training available regarding the new content approval process (titled “Knowledge Content – Quality Assurance 
				Process”) available through Focus. This training is recommended for all who create, assist in creation, or approve 
				content. To take this training, navigate to Focus and search for course 00155856. There are also additional training 
				resources available on the QA Portal page.</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q15');">Who should I contact with questions or comments about this new process?</a></div>
				<div id="q15" class="answer hidden"><p>A QA team within Knowledge Services has been established to coordinate the new process across the entire U.S. firm, 
				while supporting service levels and preserving our compliance with applicable policies and guidelines. Questions and 
				comments can be sent to US-CSS ContentQA Mailbox.</p>

				<p>To learn more about the new QA process, please visit the QA Portal page where you will find a number of reference 
				materials, including KLearn and MSO training sessions, as well as the link to initiate content review.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q16');">What is QAS Sponsorship?</a></div>
				<div id="q16" class="answer hidden"><p>Quality Assurance Service (QAS) is a set of standards for Web-based self-study programs, defined by the National 
				Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA). Certain states (listed below) will only accept CPE credit for 
				a self-study if that self-study meets rigorous QAS standards, and is offered by a QAS Sponsor. As of August 5, 2010, 
				KPMG has been approved as a QAS Sponsor by NASBA, and is now able to offer QAS CPE credit for courses that 
				conform to QAS standards.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Not all KPMG self-studies conform to QAS requirements. Please refer to <font color="#007c92"><u>Quality Assurance Service (QAS) CPE Credit</u></font> for instructions on how to locate QAS-eligible self-studies in Focus.</li>
						<li>QAS standards apply only to Web-based self-studies. All states, including those listed below, will recognize CPE credit that KPMG awards for instructor-led or KLEARN LIVE! training.</li>
					</ul>
					
				<p>State Boards of Accountancy in the following states will only recognize CPE credit for a self-study if that self-study 
				is a QAS-approved course offered by a QAS Sponsor:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Florida</li>
						<li>Minnesota</li>
						<li>Tennessee</li>
						<li>Oregon</li>
						<li>South Carolina</li>
					</ul>
					 
				<p>Because KPMG is now a QAS sponsor, the firm is now able to offer CPE credit for some internally-produced 
				self-studies.In addition, all self-studies produced by certain external vendors are eligible for QAS CPE credit.</p>

				<p><i>Note: QAS sponsorship is for self-study programs only. There is no QAS sponsorship for instructor-led training or 
				virtual classroom/KLEARN LIVE! training.</i></p>
