				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q1');">What is KPMG Learning?</a></div>
				<div id="q1" class="answer hidden"><p>KPMG Learning is KPMG’s answer to what our professionals, our clients and the marketplace have asked for: a one-stop shop for quality training in technical accounting and related topics in formats geared to various learning modes –web-based self-study, podcasts, webcasts, webinars and classroom seminars. </p>
				
				<p>KPMG Learning hosts a catalog of KPMG training courses that can be accessed in two ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><u>KPMG Learning internal portal</u></b>:  Here, KPMG Partners and employees can search for and download risk-reviewed courses and other instructor-led training materials that can then be delivered to clients. The programs found on KPMG Learning can be recommended to clients to help them close skill gaps, to accumulate CPE credits, or for general developmental purposes. 
					</li>
					
					<li><b><u>KPMG Learning external website</u></b> is accessible to the general public, so that clients, targets and the public at large can directly access KPMG Learning  training materials, if they so choose.</li>
					
				</ul>
				
				</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q2');">What type of content can I find on KPMG Learning?</a></div>

Complementing these well-established learning modes is a new offering – web-based training (WBT) self-study courses that allow users to access and complete self-study training modules online for CPE credit.  </div>
