				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q1');">What are the KPMG “Independence” requirements with regards to delivering training services to my client? </a></div>
				<div id="q1" class="answer hidden"><p>One of the most important aspects of our “promise of professionalism” is the requirement to be independent in fact and perception.  Compliance with independence standards is a professional responsibility prerequisite to providing audit, review and other attestation services. This pledge to independence is essential to serving the best interests of our clients and their investors -- and to furthering KPMG’s reputation for integrity and quality.</p>

	<p>In certain instances, delivery of training to our audit clients (public and non-public) may raise independence questions. Please refer to the <a href="../pageAssets/docs/client_training_independence_considerations.xlsx" target="_blank" class="externalLink">Independence Matrix</a> to determine whether your particular client situation is subject to Audit Committee pre-approval, Sentinel, or CLEAS.</p>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q2');">If I need to change or alter a course content, what approvals are needed before I deliver the course to a client?</a></div>
				<div id="q2" class="answer hidden">We are aware that, in some cases, as-designed training content may not meet the specific needs of you client or target,
				and tailoring or revision is required. Knowing how to obtain the appropriate internal approvals prior to providing training 
				externally is vital to our organization. According to firm policy, if more than 15% of the course content is revised, the 
				course must be approved via the Knowledge Content Quality Assurance (QA) process. In addition, revising a course 
				may have Continuing Professional Education (CPE) implications (refer to the <font color="#007c92"><u>CPE Toolkit</u></font> section for more information).</div>

				<div class="question"><a href="javascript:showHideDiv('q3');">What is the Knowledge Content Quality Assurance (QA) Process?</a></div>
				<div id="q3" class="answer hidden">Endorsed by U.S. firm leadership, The Knowledge Content Quality Assurance (QA) online process was established to 
				coordinate the review and approval for knowledge content. Please refer to the Quality Assurance FAQs for more 
				information.</div>
