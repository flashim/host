				<p>The training session ends – and CPE Certificates of Completion are sent directly to your client – <i>quickly and efficiently!</i></p>

				<p>Our clients have asked for it, and some of our competitors have similar programs in place. </p>

				<p>Sound unrealistic? Not anymore. In fact, clients who opt to access the web-based self study training courses on <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> 
				can receive their CPE Certificates of Completion immediately upon successful completion of the self study!</p>  

				<p>A key feature on the recently launched here as part of the <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b> internal portal, the <b><i>KPMG Learning CPE Toolkit</i></b> 
				contains specific guidance on the steps necessary <i><u>before</u></i>, <i><u>during</u></i> and <i><u>after</u></i> delivering training to make that your clients receive their CPE Certificates 
				in record time.</p>

				<p>The new <b><i>Toolkit</i></b> specifically focuses on enhancing some key areas that have historically slowed CPE processing times: </p>
				
				<ol>
					<li><p><u>Submission Challenges</u>:  NASBA guidelines require that KPMG document certain details about each program where CPE is granted.  The Toolkit now helps make that documentation process easier – especially when engagement teams leverage courses from the KPMG Learning catalog. Ultimate responsibility for accurate and timely submission remains with the engagement team.</p></li>
					<li><p><u>Processing Challenges</u>:  In 2011 more than 100,000 CPE hours were awarded to clients and targets. The HRSC processing team has met challenges in keeping up with ever-increasing demand for client CPE processing.  In 2012, additional resources dedicated to processing client CPE have been added.</p></li>
				</ol>
				

				<p>Regardless of whether you deliver the training to your clients or if they access it directly on <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b>, 
				their Certificates of Completion will be executed more rapidly than has been possible in the past.</p> 

				<p>Of course, the <a href="mailto:us-learning@kpmg.com" class="externalLink"><b><i>KPMG Learning Management Team</i></b></a> is available to help you quickly address any CPE-related questions.</p>

				<p>Visit <a href="../pageAssets/docs/cpe_tookit.pdf" target="_blank" class="externalLink">CPE Toolkit</a> for more information and the specific steps involved in the KPMG Learning CPE qualification process.</p>

				<p>Currently three major factors contributed to slow or delayed processing of CPE: <div id="t1" class="toggleDiv" onclick="showHideDivToggle('box1', 't1')"><img src="../pageAssets/images/down_arrow.png" width="15" height="14" border="0" /></div></p> 
				
				<div id="box1" class="togglebox hidden">
					<ul>
						<li><p>Delayed Submission by Engagement Teams:  Engagement teams do not submit courses for processing in a timely 
	manner. Any delay invariably increases the time needed to process CPE, sometimes significantly.</p></li>

						
						<li><p>Unmet NASBA requirements:  Under NASBA guidelines, every course that KPMG grants CPE must meet certain 
	requirements related to content development, instructional design quality, and course delivery. Each submission 
	must be complete and accurate.</p></li>

						<li><p>Capacity and course overload:  In 2010 more than 60,000 CPE hours were awarded to clients and targets, placing 
	a significant burden on the CPE processing team.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				
				<p></p>
				
				<div class="emptyDiv"><p>The streamlined process built into the <b><i>CPE Toolkit</i></b> addresses these factors head on. The result: faster CPE processing 
time. Our clients have asked for it, and some of our competitors have similar programs in place. KPMG has responded 
to this challenging task by developing the KPMG <b><i>KPMG Learning CPE Toolkit</i></b>. <div id="t2" class="toggleDiv" onclick="showHideDivToggle('box2', 't2')"><img src="../pageAssets/images/down_arrow.png" width="15" height="14" border="0" /></div></p>

				<div id="box2" class="togglebox hidden">
					<p>A streamlined CPE process is also available to clients who opt to access the web-based training modules on 
<b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b>. That’s because the majority of these e-learning courses have been pre-qualified for CPE.</p>

						
					<p>Regardless of whether you deliver the training to your clients or if they access it directly on <b><i>KPMG Learning</i></b>, their
Certificates of Completion will be executed more rapidly than has been possible in the past.</p>
